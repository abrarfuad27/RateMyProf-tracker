Marshall  Levett,Austin Community College,Counseling department,10/14/2011,5,1,Such a easy class. It\'s simple. Do your homework and pay attention and you will fly right by or be the person that blames him for not leaarning. He wont let you fail. just ask for help....,M
Soazig  Le Bihan,University of Montana - Missoula,Philosophy department,09/05/2017,5,5,"A very hard class, and a massive amount of work. But, Soazig is also very good about explaining difficult concepts, gives excellent feedback, and is very accessible for extra assistance.",F
Soazig  Le Bihan,University of Montana - Missoula,Philosophy department,07/17/2017,1,4,"Took 100 level class for Ethics offered online as an option to fill a core requirement She was terrible! Did not seem to have a grasp of the English language nor does she seem to have a grasp on reality as she insisted many times that failure in an ENTRY LEVEL, OPTIONAL class is very common due to the ""difficulty"" of material, very full of herself",F

Soazig  Le Bihan,University of Montana - Missoula,Philosophy department,07/29/2009,5,5,"She is an extremely demanding professor. The work load is a big one. But she is also extremely helpful and explains things very clearly. She\'s not a professor for slackers... not and easy A, but definitely not impossible. Show up. Pay attention. Ask for help.",F
Gyda  Swayney,University of Montana - Missoula,Psychology department,01/23/2010,3,2,"Boo. When I took multicultural psych from Dr. Swaney it was more like Salish Psych. The first day (of a 300 level class!) we went over APA style guidelines and how to use blackboard. She\'s a nice person, but should not be teaching at a college level.",F
Stephanie  Domitrovich,University of Montana - Missoula,Health & Human Performance department,07/22/2015,5,3,Steph was very helpful and cared about our experience. She wanted to be sure we learned and were comfortable with everything before our testing. Go to her office hours if you need help. I learned a lot.,F
Stephanie  Domitrovich,University of Montana - Missoula,Health & Human Performance department,07/22/2015,5,2,One of the best classes I took at UM.,F
Stephanie  Domitrovich,University of Montana - Missoula,Health & Human Performance department,01/16/2013,1,4,"Stephanie ALWAYS had a mad or bored or ""I could be doing so many better things with my time right now than babysitting these college students"" look on her face. When a student asked a question, she quickly breezed over a vague explanation and speededly moved to the next subject. She is extremely unapproachable and cold, and ""tricky.""",F
Stephanie  Domitrovich,University of Montana - Missoula,Health & Human Performance department,05/06/2010,4.5,4,"She was awesome! If you went to class and listened actively good grades were easy to get. She is extremely helpful to anyone who actually goes out to seek help. My advice show up to class, ask questions and go to office hours if you need more help.",F
Stephanie  Domitrovich,University of Montana - Missoula,Health & Human Performance department,01/24/2010,1.5,5,Horrible. I went to class everyday and it still didn\'t make a difference. Her tests do not reflect her level of teaching.,F
Stephanie  Domitrovich,University of Montana - Missoula,Health & Human Performance department,12/15/2009,3.5,3,I thought she did great. The PP slides just mean you don\'t have to write notes yourself. She is a joy to have as a teacher if you PARTICIPATE and SHOW UP TO CLASS!!! People who **** are the ones who never show up. She can be very funny & I enjoyed this class very much.,F
Stephanie  Domitrovich,University of Montana - Missoula,Health & Human Performance department,12/05/2009,1.5,4,terrible!,F
Stephanie  Domitrovich,University of Montana - Missoula,Health & Human Performance department,12/03/2009,2,5,"she talks too fast, she doesn\'t do anything in the class--she doesn\'t make her own slides, she has her TA\'s grade everything, so if you have a problem with a grade, don\'t go talk to her... she has no say in the grades. print off the slides for each lecture! they always stay the same.",F

Lawrence  MacDonnell,St. Francis Xavier University,History department,01/28/2009,4.5,3,"Wow. Have to say, we need more profs like this. His way of teaching will make one love this school. He strives on getting reactions from the students, And helping them when they need someone to understand that there is alot going on in their life rather then all about due dates. Amazing prof sadly here for a year, but Must take course if you can",M
David  Burke,Pennsylvania College of Technology,Graphic Arts department,09/28/2017,2,3,Not respectful when you ask questions.,M
David  Burke,Pennsylvania College of Technology,Graphic Arts department,05/25/2014,5,1,he is an amazing teacher. if you are looking for experience with your camera and you\'re looking for easy class to attend I recommend Mr. Burke. to be honest with you do your work and you will receive a big A in the end of this course. thank you Mr. Burke.,M
David  Burke,Pennsylvania College of Technology,Graphic Arts department,02/05/2012,5,1,He is a GREAT instructor. Had him for B&W photography. He actually cares about his students and is very easy to get along with. He helps anytime you need it and is a funny guy too. Definetly recommended,M
David  Burke,Pennsylvania College of Technology,Graphic Arts department,04/29/2010,5,1,"Very good teacher, easy going, very knowledgeable, extremely nice, extremely helpful, funny.

Dana  Rush,Pacific Lutheran University,Physics department,06/20/2015,2.5,3,Was told that he was a great prof and I honestly can\'t stand him. He contradicts himself. His lectures are long and they drag out and the way he talks to women is degrading. Be prepared to feel like you are in middle school again. Thanks for ruining a subject that I am actually interested in..,M
Dana  Rush,Pacific Lutheran University,Physics department,01/24/2013,3,3,Very boring class. Don\'t go into it thinking it will be a piece of cake...because you will still have to study for the A.,M
Dana  Rush,Pacific Lutheran University,Physics department,02/03/2012,4,2,A nice professor to talk to outside of class and has a lot of information. He is willing to tell a story or two if you have time and probably into math or science. He teaches well and his tests are not like his reviews. Be careful when it is for the final because he shoved what was left of the final into one session.,M
Dana  Rush,Pacific Lutheran University,Physics department,12/13/2011,1.5,1,"Pointless class. If you actually want to learn anything, don\'t take this class. Horrible Professor. Extremely uneducated. Very unclear about expectations and don\'t ask for help because he\'s useless. By far the worst teacher I\'ve had since middle school.",M
Dana  Rush,Pacific Lutheran University,Physics department,09/28/2009,5,1,He over-explains everything and goes of on meaningless tangents. The class feels like a middle school science course instead of a college one. I was disappointed with the simplicity of everything and wish i could actually learn something that i didn\'t know.,M
Dana  Rush,Pacific Lutheran University,Physics department,01/28/2009,3.5,3,"Dana is as quirky as they come. His dramatic ""events"" at the end and beginning of the semester make for a unique memory. As for the class, Astronomy is a good GUR to get out of the way. He has reasonable expectations (except maybe being OCD about grammar) and all you have to do is turn is assignments and take quizzes. Funny guy.",M
Angia  MacOmber,Taylor University,Education department,12/11/2012,5,2,She is super nice! she tries so hard! I think everyone likes her :) She doesn\'t ever return graded things tho...whatever. It\'s a real easy class.,F
Angia  MacOmber,Taylor University,Education department,05/26/2011,4.5,2,She is a very nice person and works hard to get to know her students. She is disorganized and takes forever to grade assignments. It wasn\'t a difficult class but I enjoyed it and did learn from her.,F
Angia  MacOmber,Taylor University,Education department,04/15/2010,2,1,"This woman is very unorganized. She never grades and returns papers on time, but is a nice woman. However, being a professor takes more than that. I didn\'t actually learn anything from her.",F

Ayumi  Gervais,Grossmont College,Foreign Languages department,11/16/2017,5,3,I LOVE Gervais!! She always answers questions and is very nice and polite! She is very clear about what she wants and if you ever need help she\'s happy to do so! She makes learning Japanese so fun :),F
Ayumi  Gervais,Grossmont College,Foreign Languages department,01/27/2015,5,3,"She makes the class easier than expected. Leaves very little amount of homework and the quizzes are generally easy if you\'ve been keeping up with the class. There is little down-time outside of class, which made this a very easy to follow class. She is strict within the structure of her syllabus and due dates. Do your homework and study!",F
Ayumi  Gervais,Grossmont College,Foreign Languages department,11/20/2013,5,3,"She\'s a very fair grader. Try to do well on the quizzes! they count for more than you\'d expect. the homework load is pretty sizeable, but she spaces it out well so you always have time to do it if you make the time to do it. She seems intimidating, but is really helpful.",F
Ayumi  Gervais,Grossmont College,Foreign Languages department,03/31/2011,5,1,"Perfect teacher if there ever was one. Sticks strictly to schedules, has a detailed syllabus, follows syllabus exactly, homework is evenly spaced out, No excessive homework, and has a teaching style that is very effective to retain knowledge. She has us do one skit but is short and easy.",F
Ayumi  Gervais,Grossmont College,Foreign Languages department,11/05/2009,5,3,"Superb teacher! You do need to do your, homework, and study outside of class to keep up. The pace of 121 is much faster, you\'ll have an exam every other week, and frequent tests, and journals. You\'re gonna be learning a lot of vocab every couple of weeks, but If you kept up in 120, then you should be fine. ayumi sensei is wonderful :)",F
Ayumi  Gervais,Grossmont College,Foreign Languages department,07/28/2009,5,2,"A wonderful teacher. You do need to apply yourself outside of class to keep up, but the hw is pretty fun. I heard she was teaching 121 and signed up right away.",F
Ayumi  Gervais,Grossmont College,Foreign Languages department,07/22/2009,4.5,3,"Fantastic professor. Definitely the one you want to take if you\'re looking to take Japanese at Grossmont. Frequent tests and exams, and 1-2 pages of homework due out of the workbook every day, but it\'s not overbearing. The pace of the class was excellent, the cultural discussions kept things interesting. And she\'s really nice! A+, Sensei. =)",F
Jodee  Keller,Pacific Lutheran University,Social Work department,11/14/2017,5,1,"She gets a little off topic and frazzled, but she\'s very caring and knows a lot about her subject. Very sweet and cares about each student and their success!",F
Jodee  Keller,Pacific Lutheran University,Social Work department,11/12/2014,3.5,2,"She is extremely kind and cares a lot about the students. Relies upon power points and unhelpful comments, but is overall a good class to find out if Social Work is the major for you!",F
Jodee  Keller,Pacific Lutheran University,Social Work department,11/07/2014,4.5,3,One of the most caring professors at PLU She is sweet and I think students take advantage of that sometimes. She is willing to go out of her way to help you out and she wants to make sure you are learning and getting what you need out of the class. She really tries.,F
Jodee  Keller,Pacific Lutheran University,Social Work department,02/13/2013,2,3,Terrible. Extremely unclear. Has no idea how to lead class discussions. Doesn\'t stay on track. Very unprepared. Disappointed that I spend so much money to go to school and get stuck with professors like Jodee.,F
Jodee  Keller,Pacific Lutheran University,Social Work department,12/15/2012,4.5,1,"She is a wonderful person. Nice & helpful. brought cookies last day of class. Tests were more applied &less memorizing. A lot of common sense stuff. Students take advantage of her quietness & can be disrespectful when she\'s trying to talk or teach. It\'s not her fault, college students should act like college students & automatically be respectful.",F
Jodee  Keller,Pacific Lutheran University,Social Work department,07/31/2011,3.5,3,Okay,F
Jodee  Keller,Pacific Lutheran University,Social Work department,12/12/2010,4.5,1,Amazing,F

Jodee  Keller,Pacific Lutheran University,Social Work department,01/28/2009,2,2,Prof. Keller is extremely unassertive as a teacher. I felt like I was in a middle school class with people having to be reminded about speaking in turn. Also a poor facilitator of discussions.,F
Gina  Gillie,Pacific Lutheran University,Music department,02/26/2018,5,4,"Dr. Gillie is a respectful and kind teacher. She is tougher, only because she wants us to try our best. She is a very lenient grader, and is always willing to help.",F
Gina  Gillie,Pacific Lutheran University,Music department,12/22/2012,5,2,"I LOVED this class. By far my favorite course. Dr. Gillie is the bomb! Great teacher, and super caring about her students learning. Kind of difficult, but worth every second.",F
Gina  Gillie,Pacific Lutheran University,Music department,11/13/2012,2,4,I advise no one to take this class. She is like a middle school teacher looking for someone to punish. Also takes music 101 too far for people only trying to take as a pre req. stay away if you can!!!,F
Gina  Gillie,Pacific Lutheran University,Music department,09/11/2010,5,4,Dr. Gillie takes the fear out of Ear Training and makes it an enjoyable subject. She is very in-tune (no pun intended) with student life and is very understandable.,F
Gina  Gillie,Pacific Lutheran University,Music department,04/22/2010,5,3,Dr. Gillie is fantastic! Great energy and teaches concepts clearly. She makes ear training WAY less scary!,F
Gina  Gillie,Pacific Lutheran University,Music department,04/14/2009,4,3,Professor Gillie is just like a student. She\'s young and fun and totally approachable. Ear training can often be scary but she makes it not seem so bad.,F
Emily  Pink,Madison Area Technical College,Education department,04/26/2018,5,3,Emily is the best professor Ive had here at Madison college! She is so committed to her students. And my favorite part is that she is so passionate about early childhood education it is easy to learn from her because you trust her experience and knowledge and you trust that she cares whole heartedly about what shes teaching. I adore Emily!!,F
Emily  Pink,Madison Area Technical College,Education department,07/12/2017,4,3,Emily was the best online teacher I have ever had. Not only is she very understanding but when it came to having a complicated assignment or needing help she was always very quick to be there for her students. I was taking an exam when my computer died. she literally stopped what she was doing just so that I could finish my exam.,F
Emily  Pink,Madison Area Technical College,Education department,04/01/2017,5,3,"Emily is super kind, very compassionate and knows Early Childhood. I highly recommend her, great story teller.",F
Emily  Pink,Madison Area Technical College,Education department,04/25/2016,5,2,EMILY IS AN AMAZING PERSON! REALLY ENJOYED HER FEEDBACK AND GAVE GREAT IDEAS OF HOW TO DEAL WITH CHILDREN!,F
Buffy  Quinn,Onondaga Community College,Science department,12/26/2017,5,2,"Buffy is such a great professor! The class is super fun, and if you\'re bad at science I think you\'ll like this course (it doesn\'t even feel like a science class)! It\'s a very easy course too you\'ll most likely get an A (assuming you won\'t skip class a lot)",F
Buffy  Quinn,Onondaga Community College,Science department,01/20/2017,4,3,"Buffy is the sweetest, kindest professor I\'ve ever had. She is very passionate about GIS and enthusiastic. It\'s such a joy to take her courses because she actively cares about what she teaches. Although it\'s a long course once a week, Buffy really makes it interesting and fun. Don\'t second guess, take GIS!",F
Buffy  Quinn,Onondaga Community College,Science department,04/08/2016,5,1,Buffy is the funniest professor on campus. She makes the class so easy to understand. Take her. Most likely an easy A to add to your semester. Very nice and willing to help. Not much homework either.,F
Buffy  Quinn,Onondaga Community College,Science department,08/09/2015,5,3,"She knows what she\'s doing, which is hard to come by in GIS. Lectures give good info on how to use the ArcGIS program. No worries if you have trouble in class, she\'d be more than willing to help out. Easy to get a decent grade in this class as long as you keep up on the projects.",F
Buffy  Quinn,Onondaga Community College,Science department,05/15/2015,5,3,"Loved this class, LOVED Buffy! Class was complex and interesting, gives a ton of helpful advice.",F
Buffy  Quinn,Onondaga Community College,Science department,01/21/2015,4,2,"I took the disasternatural hazard class with her and it was amazing! Super interesting stuff and did not feel like a science class at all. Buffy is so sweet and very understanding of you ever have to miss class or make up a test. Very few assignments, a few quizzes and only 2 major tests.",F
Buffy  Quinn,Onondaga Community College,Science department,12/24/2014,4.5,3,I was sure I was going to hate GIS. Buffy helped so much and made everything so much more clear. She\'s easy to get along with and she\'s hands down one of my favorite teachers. I love her!,F

David  Stroup,Cuyahoga Community College (all campuses),Mathematics department,08/29/2017,5,1,He is an AWESOME professor! So helpful and extremely knowledgable. He reviews any math concepts you may have forgotten. He gives tons of opportunities to boost your grade and makes class enjoyable. He prepares you well for exams and breaks down everything into simple and easy to understand terms. I loved his class and he taught me a lot!,M
David  Stroup,Cuyahoga Community College (all campuses),Mathematics department,08/02/2017,5,1,"David is a phenomenal professor. I seriously can\'t think of a way that I could have made this class any better. His exams are straight forward, he prepares you for them, and he explains complex subjects really well. His smile is also really funny, it makes me laugh every time. I really enjoyed learning from him and will be missing his class.",M
David  Stroup,Cuyahoga Community College (all campuses),Mathematics department,05/01/2017,4,4,"Stroup is a calculus professor, so HE isn\'t hard, the CLASS is hard. He cares about his students, and is very willing to help. Gives plenty of extra credit, and even more if you ask him personally. He wants to see that you are working, so do the homework and take the projects to the tutors.",M
David  Stroup,Cuyahoga Community College (all campuses),Mathematics department,03/06/2017,1,5,HE IS HORRIBLE!!!!!!!! I LOVED MATH UNTIL I TOOK HIS CLASS. DO NOT TAKE HIM IF YOU HAVE OTHER OPTIONS!!!!!!!!!,M
David  Stroup,Cuyahoga Community College (all campuses),Mathematics department,02/15/2017,5,2,I love Professor Stroup. He is like a kid. He is genius about Math. I will take him again.,M
David  Stroup,Cuyahoga Community College (all campuses),Mathematics department,02/03/2017,5,3,Grade highly reflect from your basic initial understanding in calculus as long as you are supplementarily active as a student. Just simply do not take his classes if you think input work equals direct output of reward like GPA. If you thought you had any form of intelligence but reality tells otherwise become an acountant like the rest.,M

A lot of homework on math lab but it helps you get a good grade on test!! Very nice guy!! Never expect to get out early. He follows his syllabus to a ""T"" 5 tests and a final and he gives you reviews & does it in class (test is just like review) great teacher!! Makes it easy to understand.",M
David  Stroup,Cuyahoga Community College (all campuses),Mathematics department,11/03/2016,5,3,I absolutely love professor Stroup. He is very good at explaining the problems. If he notices that students are having difficult time with any chapters... he will spend extra time on it to make sure everyone understands it. Highly recommend him.,M
David  Stroup,Cuyahoga Community College (all campuses),Mathematics department,08/11/2016,5,2,"Professor Stroup is pretty lenient on his students. He gives out study guides, he allows you to turn in homework late, he gives extra credit, what more could you want? I had to go for math tutoring in High School. After taking Calc 2 with Stroup, trust me he is not bad at all. If you can\'t pass Calc 2 at Tri-C you can\'t pass it anywhere.",M

David  Stroup,Cuyahoga Community College (all campuses),Mathematics department,05/18/2016,4.5,3,I loved Professor Stroup! One of my favorite professors that I had. He was funny and helpful with his students. I loved his teaching style and was surprised with how well I did in a Math class since I\'m not too good at math.,M
David  Stroup,Cuyahoga Community College (all campuses),Mathematics department,02/03/2016,2.5,5,A lot of long homework assignments. Tests are very hard and challenging. I wish that he would give extra credits on each test for a reward and to help with a grade. Study guide for the test would\'ve help but we don\'t get any.,M
David  Stroup,Cuyahoga Community College (all campuses),Mathematics department,01/26/2016,4,3,"Had him for Calc 2 and knew what he was talking about. Calc isn\'t my favorite subject, but helped me understand it better. Gives quite a bit of homework, but should prepare you for tests. Tests are sort of hard, but gives study guides to give you a good idea of what kind of problems to expect. Also gives extra credit to help your grade.",M
David  Stroup,Cuyahoga Community College (all campuses),Mathematics department,01/20/2016,4.5,3,"Prof. Stroup was a replacement prof halfway through the semester, and he literally saved the class.

His tests will challenge you, but he prepares you well. Best Calc teacher ever.",M
David  Stroup,Cuyahoga Community College (all campuses),Mathematics department,12/11/2015,4,3,"There was a lot of homework, but if you do all of the homework, you will pass.

He had a tendency to go off on tangents about different ways to solve problems that are irreverent to the class, but in general he\'s pretty good.",M
David  Stroup,Cuyahoga Community College (all campuses),Mathematics department,09/04/2015,4.5,3,"He is a very smart teacher and goes over what is needed during lectures. He tends to explain proofs which helps better understand the material. Some book questions tough, tests are medium difficulty. Study guides help narrow down what you will need to know thoroughly for exams. You will be a Calculus II pro with Stroup. Very good teacher!",M
David  Stroup,Cuyahoga Community College (all campuses),Mathematics department,05/10/2015,4.5,2,"He is tough in that he expects you to put in work.

Great professor.",M

He strives to help students pass and really tries to prepare you for the future.

He is super nerdy because he is passionate about math, but that\'s what makes him an excellent teacher. He is one of the rare ones that doesn\'t lecture you like you should already know the material.

Kerry  Heafner,Limestone College,Biology department,08/05/2010,5,3,Professor Heafner was very nice and he made the entire bio101 experience exciting. I could tell he truly loves what he does and is extremely knowledgeable.,M
Kerry  Heafner,Limestone College,Biology department,02/01/2009,1,4,"Mr. Heafner is the worst professor I\'ve ever had in my entire collegiate career. He taught straight from powerpoint, filled with slides that contained information that didn\'t correspond with the book material. Tests were filled with questions not from lectures or book. He doesn\'t have a doctorate, and it\'s very evident. Don\'t take him.",M
Brenda  Coley,Central Texas College,Psychology department,07/30/2012,2,1,"Unfair grading. Earned A - She insisted I didn\'t although I had proof- told me no 1 rcvd A .Peers later conf there were in fact A\'s given. Had us work on a class project for weeks & then didnt grade it .Allowed unproductive , non essential chit chat to take over class when she was on break from ""tooting""her own horn. Lacks professionalism.",F

Kathryn  Austin,Florida Atlantic University,Theater department,03/13/2009,4,2,amazing!,F
Michael  McGivern,American InterContinental University Online,Management department,01/28/2009,5,2,He\'s extremely helpful and understanding. He\'s was the best professor I had in the AIU MBA program.,M
Joanne  Hwang,Austin Community College,Mathematics department,07/13/2017,3,3,"Professor Hwang is ok at teach the material, but sometimes she does go a little fast. She\'s an easy grader and if you attempt to work the problems, she\'ll give partial credit. She also provided many opportunities for extra credit. She is pretty funny if you catch her sense of humor.",F
Joanne  Hwang,Austin Community College,Mathematics department,03/20/2015,4,2,"I took the (very easy) college mathematics course with her. (Maybe that\'s why I liked her and others didn\'t). She was very helpful, she would explain different ways to do the problems and was RARELY disrespectful to the students (sometimes someone would say something really really dumb though...) I always felt like my questions were answered well.",F
Joanne  Hwang,Austin Community College,Mathematics department,03/29/2014,4.5,1,"She is not as other review. she is helpful and wants her students to succeed. if you do homework and practice her previous exams, you can make easy A.",F
Joanne  Hwang,Austin Community College,Mathematics department,12/28/2013,4,5,"She is not helpful when you ask for help. Joanne berates the students she does not like during class in front of the other students, very unprofessional. Joanne powerpoints are good but that about all. She rushes through material, when asked to repeat she gets upset. Her grading is not fair when she take off for comas.",F
Joanne  Hwang,Austin Community College,Mathematics department,12/24/2013,5,1,"She\'s pretty good as far as my experience went. The material is basic and most of the work is explained clearly. Idk why people complain about her, I understand not everyone can grasp the concepts but its not like she doesn\'t offer help. She\'s always at her office and she always willing to help. She\'s nice too!",F
Joanne  Hwang,Austin Community College,Mathematics department,12/06/2013,1,4,Terrible teacher but a nice lady if you are good in math and statistics already this will be an easy class\xe2\x80\xa6she grades on a curve anyway. But if you struggle in class DO NOT TAKE IT WITH HER! And if you get stuck in it plan to live in the learning lab and ask for Conrad (Round Rock Campus),F
Joanne  Hwang,Austin Community College,Mathematics department,08/07/2013,3,4,"This instructor is much better on many levels than most of the reviews here indicate. I took her course in a 5.5-week summer semester and made an A. I am weak in math, don\'t like math courses...just follow instructions.",F
Joanne  Hwang,Austin Community College,Mathematics department,07/07/2013,3.5,3,Professor Hwang is a very fair professor. She doesn\'t try to surprise you or make the class impossible. she does have a lot of assignments and you do need to show up and pay attention. She is attentive and wants her students to succeed. If you show up and do what\'s assigned you will get an A.,F
Joanne  Hwang,Austin Community College,Mathematics department,06/01/2013,5,1,Great professor.,F
Joanne  Hwang,Austin Community College,Mathematics department,05/21/2013,1,5,Very nice person but horrible professor. Expects you to come to every class knowing the material. The examples she uses in class are way different then the ones on the test. She does not have math teaching ability. Only take this class if you are willing to study and learn the material on your own!,F
Joanne  Hwang,Austin Community College,Mathematics department,07/10/2009,1,5,Her written English is extremely poor for a prof with a MS. On numerous occasions both students & tutors were unable to comprehend her questions on a quiz. You were out of luck with understanding the English of poorly written exams. Teachers have to demonstrate proficiency in English--so should Profs. Hire a translator for her written English.,F
Joanne  Hwang,Austin Community College,Mathematics department,07/03/2009,2,5,Great Class if you can\'t read because she reads the textbook word for word from the overhead.Explanations during class not good. Explanations after class better. Too much of a class for 5.5 weeks,F
Joanne  Hwang,Austin Community College,Mathematics department,06/18/2009,1.5,5,If you can\'t figure it out by yourself or with classmates help she is useless. She doesn\'t comprehend silence from the class means no one understands her. I\'d never take another class taught by Prof Joanne Hwang.,F
Joanne  Hwang,Austin Community College,Mathematics department,04/12/2009,2,4,Great class to take IF you already know statistics. She gives you notes with a lot of vocab. Not very good at explaining things for others with different learning styles. She teaches above the elementary class level.,F
David  Gruber,Bard College,Not Specified department,12/14/2009,2.5,2,Gruber is ok. His Fysem class wasn\'t bad and he wasn\'t too tough of a teacher. Not a great class but not a good on either. If you want an easy class this could be the class for you.,M
David  Gruber,Bard College,Not Specified department,12/10/2009,2.5,4,"Classroom discussion was abysmal. I still really have no idea what he wants from papers, even after seeing him after class a few times during the semester. He was eager to help, but he doesn\'t really know what he wants, so he couldn\'t really help all that much.",M
David  Gruber,Bard College,Not Specified department,12/09/2009,4.5,4,"David is a wonderful FYSEM professor. While he doesn\'t absolutely pile on the reading, his class moves at a steady pace, and his discussions are always engaging. He\'s especially good at encouraging and facilitating participation, and his papers, while difficult, are often rewarding and graded clearly and methodically. Strict but caring. Very good.",M
David  Gruber,Bard College,Not Specified department,12/03/2009,5,1,Grubs is really helpful and you\'ll laugh at his awkwardness. He is helpful. A good FYSEM prof to have.,M
Harriet  Strickland,Coastal Carolina University,Biology department,02/03/2009,5,1,Really easy A but she\'s just boring.,F
Harriet  Strickland,Coastal Carolina University,Biology department,01/26/2009,5,1,"Very nice teacher. Easy class, just show up. All lectures are on blackboard. For tests, read over lectures and you should be fine. Plenty of extra credit as well, even though it\'s really not needed. Easy assignments. Overall, a great professor although, class is sometimes a little slow.",F
Hobson,Riverside City College,English department,01/28/2009,3,3,IT WAS HER FIRST YEAR SO TEACHING. LECTURES WERE OKAY VOCAB QUIZES WERE EASY IF YOU STUDY GIVES QUIZES AT THE END OF CLASS ON THE LESSON FINAL WAS DEBATING OVERALL OKAY TEACHER,F
Janis  Langins,University of Toronto - St. George Campus,Humanities department,09/20/2011,2.5,4,"This was the absolute worst teacher I have had in University. He spoke down to his students, he was boring, he lacked any social skill what-so-ever, and his readings were ridiculous. Clawing your eyes out would be less painful than sitting through a year in his class.",M
Janis  Langins,University of Toronto - St. George Campus,Humanities department,04/14/2010,5,4,Amazing and passionate professor. he clearly cares about what he is teaching and is very organized and clear and the material is still challenging for an introductory course. Highly recommend this professor.,M
Janis  Langins,University of Toronto - St. George Campus,Humanities department,01/28/2009,5,3,"Professor Langins is interesting, engaging, and very clear and well-prepared. He posts lecture outlines on Blackboard in advance of the class, and is almost always perfectly on point. He has a wide breadth off knowledge not limited to engineering or history of technology. I\'ve taken two of his classes, and I would highly recommend him.",M
Elena  Pezzoli,University of Washington,Mathematics department,03/09/2018,2,5,"Her midterms now are nothing like her old midterms, so it was a slap in the face to everyone when we studies her old midterms and got midterms that were much more difficult. She is a nice person but what she reviews in class doesn\'t prepare you for the exams. Be ready to study a lot.",F
Elena  Pezzoli,University of Washington,Mathematics department,03/08/2018,2,4,She said the best way to study for her exams was to look at her old midterms and her old midterms seemed super easy but this year she pulled a 180 and made the exams super hard and I had to fight for points with my ta because her grading criteria was super strict. She puts unnecessary confusing word problems but the average is still pretty high.,F
Elena  Pezzoli,University of Washington,Mathematics department,02/23/2018,1,4,her old midterms seemed really easy but this quarter they became much harder. I\'m not sure why but I don\'t think the ratings on here conveys the difficulty of her class now. Her notes are really unorganized and confusing. Had to SNS the class... if you have a background in calc it might be an easy A but I wouldn\'t suggest taking it,F
Elena  Pezzoli,University of Washington,Mathematics department,02/22/2018,5,4,"Ms Pezzoli is a great professor! Her lecture was clear and sensible. Especially I love that she teaches kind of slowly, so that it\'s easy to catch up and understand. Review sessions before midterms are really useful. I would love to take her class again.",F
Elena  Pezzoli,University of Washington,Mathematics department,01/04/2018,4,3,She has an accent and writes her a\'s as e\'s but she\'s very adorable.,F
Elena  Pezzoli,University of Washington,Mathematics department,12/25/2017,4,3,Her accent was a little strong and handwriting was bad at first but I got use to it after a while. Her examples from class are similar to the hw we do or her midterms. Overall she isn\'t that bad. She isn\'t as good as Loveless but she does a decent job at teaching and prepares you well for the tests.,F
Elena  Pezzoli,University of Washington,Mathematics department,12/17/2017,2,3,"Couldn\'t understand her accent and couldn\'t decipher her handwriting. Only survived because of the lecture slides another professor posted. Course material was easy to learn, but application on the tests was whack.",F
Elena  Pezzoli,University of Washington,Mathematics department,12/16/2017,5,4,"Professor Pezzoli is very sweet! It took me a little while to adjust to her teaching style, but once I got used to it I learned a lot. In class she\'s really good about explaining things in depth, and if you don\'t understand still she\'s very helpful in office hours.",F
Elena  Pezzoli,University of Washington,Mathematics department,12/13/2017,3,4,Pretty heavy accent but very approachable outside of class. Tests are relatively easier to other professors but ALL professors come together to craft the final so be prepared for a harder final. Handwriting is impossible to decipher - so take your own notes. TAs/quiz sections were extremely useful,F
Elena  Pezzoli,University of Washington,Mathematics department,12/13/2017,5,4,"Dr. Pezzoli is a great professor. She is very accessible outside class and actually cares a lot about your learning but she has a strong accent, so it might be little hard to follow her lecture. Her tests are comparatively easier than other professors. Make sure to start preparing for the final early because it is a lot harder than the midterms.",F
Elena  Pezzoli,University of Washington,Mathematics department,10/18/2017,5,2,"Once you get used to her accent her lectures are very easy to follow. Very friendly professor who is helpful outside of class. Exams are easy if you pay attention - all of her practice questions are almost identical to what you are given on exams and in review sessions, questions similar to what will be on the exam are always covered.",F
Elena  Pezzoli,University of Washington,Mathematics department,06/13/2017,3,3,"At first I found her accent and handwriting very difficult to understand, but I got used to it after a few weeks and could understand her just fine. The only issue is going back through lecture slides is difficult bc of her handwriting. Lectures are a tad dry as well. She tells you almost exactly what\'s on exams though, which is incredibly helpful.",F
Elena  Pezzoli,University of Washington,Mathematics department,03/25/2017,4,3,"Go to class and read the textbook or you will struggle. Also, be aware that Dr. Pezzoli has an Italian accent, so if accents are hard for you to understand she may not be the professor for you. Personally, I found her easy to understand.",F
Elena  Pezzoli,University of Washington,Mathematics department,03/14/2017,4,3,"She is a pretty good professor. I am really poor at math, but she teaches with patience so that I can easily understand her. Homework is definitely helpful, sometimes is heavy, but you will finish it, so no worries. Overall, she is a good professor I think.",F
Elena  Pezzoli,University of Washington,Mathematics department,03/10/2017,2,4,"She does not go step by step but clicks through slides, and she has terrible hand writing so it is hard to follow. You do not miss much from lectures because she is hard to follow. It is a hard class",F
Elena  Pezzoli,University of Washington,Mathematics department,02/22/2017,1,5,"The worst professor I\'ve ever had. All she does is point with her laser at the slide and basically say ""this goes to this so that goes to that"". Math should be done step by step. She also just drones on and on and repeats herself, and her accent is hard to understand. Handwriting is atrocious as well. Try your best to get a different professor.",F
Elena  Pezzoli,University of Washington,Mathematics department,02/21/2017,3,4,"Despite what people may say, her accent is not bad. Her handwriting is terrible. Her lectures are pretty boring and not engaging, and can be very confusing. She often skips over important slides too quickly. Lots of homework, which is often quite difficult. The tests are slightly more difficult than homework, but still doable.",F
Elena  Pezzoli,University of Washington,Mathematics department,05/23/2016,1,5,"Really bad professor. She just stands there and points at things with her laser pointer. Math should be done in front of class, as you\'re explaining. Nope... Just stands there with a Word doc full of calculations that have been prepared beforehand, and just talks, and talks, and talks. Should not be teaching at all. Relied on my TA for EVERYTHING.",F
Elena  Pezzoli,University of Washington,Mathematics department,04/20/2016,3,3,"Just a fair warning! Has awful handwriting, like so unbelievably bad you won\'t be able to follow her notes at all, even if you think you\'re good at it. Accent isn\'t that bad though. Don\'t take her class if you just want to review her notes, all her letters look like other letters.",F
Elena  Pezzoli,University of Washington,Mathematics department,01/26/2016,3.5,3,"Lectures can be confusing sometimes because of her accent, but she\'s always able and willing to answer any questions. The homework will take a lot of your time, but it will really help when exam time comes and surprises you. Tests will require you to know more than the class material, but she\'s very generous with grading.",F
Sang-Yeob  Lee,San Francisco State University,Economics department,05/09/2010,4,4,"took his 311/312 class, midterms and finals were mostly from hw and practice exams, fairly easy class to get a B or higher. exams were curved",M
Sang-Yeob  Lee,San Francisco State University,Economics department,02/17/2010,3,3,"There are much better stats prof\'s out there. Unfortunately for econ students, you roll the dice when it comes to taking econ 311/312 because it\'s either him or another prof. Lee is a tremendously nice guy AND knows his stats very well, but his teaching it is terrible. Its the language barrier but I just don\'t understand SFSU\'s hiring practices.",M
Sang-Yeob  Lee,San Francisco State University,Economics department,06/01/2009,3,5,"Uses power point slides which are dull and boring and doesn\'t practice teaching the material before its ""taught"" making his lessons confusing. The only time he did a good job of teaching was when the econ dept. chair sat in during the lecture because the class before we had done evaluations and they apparently weren\'t good.",M
Sang-Yeob  Lee,San Francisco State University,Economics department,05/07/2009,5,3,Prof. Lee is really cool and he is always available at his office hours if you need any extra help. He posts sample mid-terms and finals that cover the content of the exam at least three weeks before the exam.,M
Sang-Yeob  Lee,San Francisco State University,Economics department,03/19/2009,1.5,4,"This class was challenging because the instructor was not able to express the materials clearly. Not to mention, he does not speak fluent English. In addition, it is even harder to understand the course materials, due to lack of samples and again fluent expression of the materials. Moreover, this class will require much practice and studying.",M
Viet  Trinh,University of Phoenix,Computer Science department,04/12/2010,2,1,"This is the first time that I had a teacher who is in the wheelchair.

Overall, he is a good teacher.",M
Viet  Trinh,University of Phoenix,Computer Science department,02/27/2010,5,5,"Viet is the best professor I had met. The reason I can evaluate him because I was a software engineer, briefly: 1. His topic is very useful and critical to programing. 2. He has hands on experiences so he know how to teach instead of talking. 3. Normally if you do not have any background before, this course is difficult.",M

Patricia  Ganea,Boston University,Psychology department,10/17/2011,2,3,I hope you can write/type fast as you\'ll need to be able to do that to keep up. She covers an entire 1.5 hour lecture in 40-50mins on average (some times only 30 mins) by talking at the speed of light. Also English isn\'t her first language which makings things trickier. It does show up on her poorly worded exams and she is stick about grade cut off,F
Patricia  Ganea,Boston University,Psychology department,08/02/2011,3.5,5,"If you\'re looking to learn about parenting, stay away from this class. It\'s all about pointless baby facts that aren\'t very applicable. Exams are COMPLETELY based on the lectures. What you get on the exams is what you get in the class, which sucks bc the ques are unclear. **Final MC ques are EXACTLY the ques on past 3 exams so review the exams!",F
Patricia  Ganea,Boston University,Psychology department,05/13/2011,2,4,"She doesn\'t care about her students. Not clear in explaining some of the concepts and moves extremely fast and let out class early every single time.

Patricia  Ganea,Boston University,Psychology department,05/11/2011,4,3,"Great professor! She is very enthusiastic about research and she was clearly knowledgeable about current research.

Patricia  Ganea,Boston University,Psychology department,05/11/2011,4,3,She is clear during lecture and goes over concepts many times. Book is useful but lectures are most important. She knows the material really well and asks questions to make sure people got it. I also enjoyed the videos she showed in class. I strongly recommend it.,F
Patricia  Ganea,Boston University,Psychology department,05/10/2011,1.5,4,Lectures are not mandatory but it\'s good to go since there will be some materials that aren\'t covered in the textbook (but she uploads the powerpoint outlines online). She\'s misleading and unclear with some of the concepts so be sure to read the books (or at least skim!). Discussions were not helpful at all! I Wouldn\'t recommend her.,F
Patricia  Ganea,Boston University,Psychology department,05/09/2011,1.5,3,She is fast. Very fast. Be prepared to take 90 mins worth of notes in 45-60 mins. We got out of lecture 30-45 mins early every time. She also has no knowledge of basic biology so she gives misleading information during the human development section. Additionally her exams are poorly written and many questions don\'t make sense.,F
Patricia  Ganea,Boston University,Psychology department,05/22/2010,4.5,3,Great professor!

Patricia  Ganea,Boston University,Psychology department,05/11/2009,3.5,4,I liked this course. Lectures do have stuff that\'s not in the textbook so it\'s good to go. She also shows short video clips with studies. I found it easier to go through the textbook after lecture. nice teacher.,F
Patricia  Ganea,Boston University,Psychology department,05/10/2009,4,3,Professor Ganea is a great teacher. She is very excited about research and she wants students to really understand the material.

Samantha  Doralp,Western University,Psychology department,12/22/2016,1,5,"Hands down the most frustrating class i have attended. The classes and concepts were no that hard conceptually, but she needs to work on making it clear what students need to take from the lecture. It was almost impossible come test time to determine what she wanted you to say in a short answer. Would strongly recommend switching/swapping.",F
Samantha  Doralp,Western University,Psychology department,05/16/2016,4,3,tries too hard to be \'cool\' but is easy to listen too. material was good and textbook only needed to be used for certain sections but not for the whole class. overall the class is fun. easy to get mid 70-80\'s on the exams,F
Samantha  Doralp,Western University,Psychology department,01/15/2016,4.5,4,"Dr. Doralp is under-appreciated as a professor. No, she\'s not going to give you an easy, high grade.

Regardless of grades, Doralp creates a great learning experience for her students - the best I\'ve had yet!",F
Samantha  Doralp,Western University,Psychology department,10/14/2015,3.5,3,"Dr, Doralp is easily my favourite prof! She adds humour and makes the lectures fun by adding videos and interesting trivia.

Great with questions",F

Once, she asked the class what we know about hemoglobin and a student said it\'s a basic building block for blood. She said, \'agh, didn\'t know\'. You didn\'t know?!?Hello Physiology 101... how are you a physiotherapist? Real talk, has no idea how to mark and should be fired. Also,THIRSTY!:S",F

Samantha  Doralp,Western University,Psychology department,10/24/2014,1,5,"WORST PROFESSOR EVER! VERY AMIGIOUS - makes the class so much harder than it needs to be. It\'s like she wants to set us up for failure. She never has energy to teach, either.",F
Samantha  Doralp,Western University,Psychology department,01/28/2014,5,5,"Extremely nice prof, but her tests are very confusing and she marks so hard compared to how she teaches.

Jamar  London,Santa Monica College,Mathematics department,11/10/2017,2,4,I took him during summer and I have to say that it was too stressful and was not worth the hours of commuting to and from home. He is very considerate of personal issues but in regards to academic help he just over complicates things and is not a good source of help. ESPECIALLY with all the homework he assigned. Try looking for someone better.,M
Jamar  London,Santa Monica College,Mathematics department,06/23/2017,3,5,The exams gets harder with the math problems and gets tricky that I wasn\'t familiar with in class. But he was a nice guy and looks out for you and ask you how is math going and helps you with math problems all the best he can during his office hours and he gives tons of homework too.,M
Jamar  London,Santa Monica College,Mathematics department,06/15/2017,4,4,Good instructor and you will have to earn your grade! Go to office hours and do all of his handouts.,M
Jamar  London,Santa Monica College,Mathematics department,05/07/2017,1,5,I can\'t say he was a bad teacher but he is very inconsiderate. He gives so much homework and then when the test comes the problems are 10x harder. If math is hard for you stay away from him. Also he\'s inconsiderate and Not understanding.,M
Jamar  London,Santa Monica College,Mathematics department,02/15/2017,1,5,"He is good in class but his exams are too difficult. He grades only exams. no extra credits, no participation. Attendance will not be graded. If you are not good at Math or math major, STAY AWAY from his class. I studied hard and did all homework but I failed.",M
Jamar  London,Santa Monica College,Mathematics department,01/03/2017,4,5,"Professor London is pretty straightforward in his lectures about what you need to know for tests. Tests can be very tricky, and he is a tough grader, so make sure you can do the tougher homework problems to be ready for test. He is more than willing to meet with you in office hours which is nice, and I would highly recommend doing.",M
Jamar  London,Santa Monica College,Mathematics department,12/31/2016,2,4,The lectures he gives are great. The only thing that\'s iffy about the class is his grading scale and how much points are worth. If you know you\'re extremely weak and Math I recommend not taking the class.,M
Jamar  London,Santa Monica College,Mathematics department,12/13/2016,5,3,"I am the absolute worst at Math, but professor London is the only teacher who has helped me understand better. He truly wants you to succeed and learn. He is very easy going and although theres a lot of homework, it isn\'t due until the test day. He grades on only tests and homework. His class wasn\'t boring! I would 10/10 take this teacher again.",M
Jamar  London,Santa Monica College,Mathematics department,12/06/2016,2,5,Professor London is an average teacher. He grades homework and exams only. He does easy problems in class and the hard ones are left for you to do at home. He somehow tries to help during his office hours but not so helpful. He sometimes talks about random things and confuses you at times.,M
Jamar  London,Santa Monica College,Mathematics department,07/15/2016,1,5,"Do not take Jamars class if you intend on being taught math. Poor teaching style, poor attitude, dissorganized, no extra credit, only grades on exams. This professor suggests ALL learning be done outside class. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND STAY AWAY, I wish I did.",M
Jamar  London,Santa Monica College,Mathematics department,05/22/2016,1.5,4,"Stay clear of his class. If you ask him a question he says ""he has no idea"". Says he wants students to come to office hours but is useless when you go.",M
Jamar  London,Santa Monica College,Mathematics department,02/18/2016,4.5,3,"If you don\'t do well in his class its because you simply arent putting in the effort. I got a C but I didnt study once, or do the homework. He was very helpful but my grade was a result of putting in zero effort. Going to his office hours is also really helpful.",M
Jamar  London,Santa Monica College,Mathematics department,02/13/2016,4.5,3,"Jamar London, is a Excellent professor, He get you ready for M2, I defiantly recommend him, he is there for you just meet up with him in his office hours, let him know your problems he is more than happy to help.

Unless you\'re really good at math, you\'re going to have to do all the homework, study the book in and out, but most of all study the lecture notes he gives. He goes over easy problems in class but the problems for homework are hard. The tests are hard too. Spent the entire semester in the math lab.",M
Jamar  London,Santa Monica College,Mathematics department,12/15/2015,4,3,He\'s a great professor. Every day he gives homework. Although his lectures could get boring he explains the material clearly and make sure that you know the material as well. No student is left behind.,M

Make sure for the first essay go to him so that he can check your outline because he is a tough grader when it comes to essays. Overall, really pay attention in the lectures and take good notes!!!

Great teacher,friend,person",M
Mike  Ott,College of the Canyons,"Radio, TV & Film department",12/15/2008,4,3,"Mike Ott is an enigma. He can be an jerk at times and he can be relatively friendly at other moments. He takes film very seriously and if you are in his class you better be the same way. No nonsense with this teacher. He can definitely be intimidating especially when he\'s on your set for your shoot.

The class itself is difficult, but he is a great professor and very helpful.",M
Adam  Chodorow,Arizona State University,Law department,04/13/2009,2.5,5,The main problem is that he gives you problem sets (that take forever) that you have to complete or else you have no idea what is going on in class.

"Howard ""Jake""  Jacobson",University of Nebraska-Kearney,Art & Art History department,10/30/2012,4.5,2,Jake is a good teacher but in ceramics there\'s only so much a good teacher can do. The class itself can be frustrating but he\'s a good teacher that helps as much as he can.,M
"Howard ""Jake""  Jacobson",University of Nebraska-Kearney,Art & Art History department,07/31/2011,2.5,2,He\'s a nice enough guy but he can be very condescending at times.

Dominic  Szeto,Cerritos College,Art department,11/12/2009,5,4,very interested in progress of students. lectures were stimulating and useful beyond the curriculum. if he comes back.. take the class it\'s one you\'ll enjoy going to,M
Dominic  Szeto,Cerritos College,Art department,09/10/2009,4.5,4,His lectures were interesting. Test consists of the art we saw in his powerpoint and the art from the book(so pay attention to them and you must read). Must go to two museums and write a 5 page paper for each. Be prepared to do some college work.,M
Dominic  Szeto,Cerritos College,Art department,08/16/2009,2,5,"well to start, this professor is no piece of cake, his test are hard and his grading toward homework is harder. The class is boring and he expects you to right whats on the power point immediately. This is really not the best professor to take art with. If you really like art, please take it with someone else. oh i did pass the class, im not lazy.",M
Dominic  Szeto,Cerritos College,Art department,08/13/2009,4.5,2,"I do admit the teacher reads a little too much into things, but the lectures are interesting.

Dominic  Szeto,Cerritos College,Art department,07/28/2009,4,3,"This teacher keeps you interested in the subject, and shows a lot of enthusiasm.

Dominic  Szeto,Cerritos College,Art department,07/17/2009,2,4,Now how d\'hell can you confuse me with what I\'ve been all my life.....HUMAN! This guy obviously thinks he\'s the sh** cos he\'s teaching college level art course..funny... throwing verbose expressions that only makes sense to him. Videos watched in class are totally luny. 7 different books in a 6 week summer class is just wrong. Do yourself a favor!,M

Kevin  Gallagher,Northern Kentucky University,Business department,12/05/2014,1,3,"Takes forever to get back to you on emails or the forums (that he set up to ask questions).

Tony  Canu,Walsh College,Mathematics department,08/16/2009,5,3,Amazing teacher!! This is a required class for numerous degree programs.

Freaked out when we asked to see the rubric she was using to grade us- avoid her- she\'s crazy!

Stay away from her",F
Caroline  Hanley,University of Massachusetts,Sociology department,03/31/2014,1,5,Terrible. She doesn\'t seem like she knows what she talks about and strays from students questions into asking them what they think about the sociological imagination is without really giving us a definition of it. I understand that we must formulate our own sociological imagination but her prompts have no way for us to show that and no solid rubric,F

Saeed  Hamdan,Gwinnett Technical College,Biology department,11/17/2015,5,2,"He was a doctor, so he really knows his stuff in this class! He\'ll knit subjects together rather than simply go after a powerpoint, which really helps you UNDERSTAND the material rather than memorize. Fair grader and always willing to help students. He is an awesome teacher.",M
Saeed  Hamdan,Gwinnett Technical College,Biology department,09/19/2015,5,3,Dr. Hamdan is THE best teacher I\'ve ever had in my life. He expects you to read before lecture but explains everything great if you don\'t understand it. Super passionate about this subject and willing to help out ANYTIME! He definitely prepares you well for the tests and for your profession as well! Knows the subject. AWESOME INSPIRATIONAL TEACHER!,M
Saeed  Hamdan,Gwinnett Technical College,Biology department,12/05/2014,5,2,He is amazing and intelligent teacher. He loves to teach and does not mind repeating himself and clarifying topics. He teaches old school and uses the board versus a bunch of power points. He is more than willing to meet before class for extra lecture for those who put in effort. He doesn\'t spoon feed students but makes anatomy easier to learn.,M
Saeed  Hamdan,Gwinnett Technical College,Biology department,07/02/2014,2,4,"Did not like, sat in on different instructors class. Wow! So much better than this professor! I wish I had taken same class but different instructor.",M
Saeed  Hamdan,Gwinnett Technical College,Biology department,04/30/2014,5,2,"See all his positive reviews, they are true. Some minor draw backs because of his accent, but he will do his best to make you understand the material.",M
Saeed  Hamdan,Gwinnett Technical College,Biology department,04/22/2014,5,4,"Looking to register for A&P? Don\'t hesitate to jump right in! Dr Hamdan has a passion for teaching both Anatomies. Answers all questions before, during, and after class. Will use real life situations to help you understand the material while preparing you for the future. He is simply the Best that there is! Take him if you find a spot in his class.",M
Saeed  Hamdan,Gwinnett Technical College,Biology department,07/10/2013,4,4,"Dr. Hamdan is one of the most unique instructors that I have had thus far. He is extremely knowledgeable and passionate about the subjects he teaches. He makes it very clear as to what is expected of you throughout the course. If you do the work and attend class regularly, he will go out of his way to help you succeed. Dr. Hamdan is an asset to GTC",M
Saeed  Hamdan,Gwinnett Technical College,Biology department,06/06/2013,4,4,I took Dr. Hamdan for A&P 1 and A&P 2. He is a fantastic professor. He comes in about an hour befor lecture to answer any question you may have. If you are in one of his lab classes he will permit you to attend his other lab class to get extra lab time. Come to class prepared and work for your grade.,M
Saeed  Hamdan,Gwinnett Technical College,Biology department,03/30/2013,4.5,5,One of the smartest people I ever encountered. He is fast and hard to understand but very thorough and very funny too. He makes sure you understand and is willing to explain it until you do. AP is no joke at GTC. Be prepared to study for hours a day. If you fail it won\'t be because of him...he is awesome!,M
Saeed  Hamdan,Gwinnett Technical College,Biology department,12/05/2012,4.5,3,Dr. Hamdan is one of the best A&P teachers. If you have any questions on the material please ask and he will help you. I really enjoyed the clinical reference he would bring to the table- regarding the material or any other interesting fact on healthcare. Please study study study if you want an A.,M
Saeed  Hamdan,Gwinnett Technical College,Biology department,09/15/2012,2,5,"My least favorite prof. of ANY other professor I have had at GTC. Accent hard to understand at times, but much more troubling was the misinformation he gave. This is important if planning to apply this knowledge to a future healthcare field. Also he would often make clerical errors when calculating or transposing test scores to computer record.",M
Saeed  Hamdan,Gwinnett Technical College,Biology department,05/13/2012,5,5,"Dr. Hamdan is WONDERFUL. His lectures are engaging and informative, I learn something new every time. I will be scanning for his name when I register for A&P 2114.",M

Saeed  Hamdan,Gwinnett Technical College,Biology department,04/03/2012,2,5,He marked things wrong on tests and would not give credit even when shown the answer matched the textbook. Some lecture information he taught was also contradictory from the textbook. His contradictory info sometimes was counted right and other times was counted wrong on tests. It was very hard to know what answer the instructor was looking for.,M
Saeed  Hamdan,Gwinnett Technical College,Biology department,12/23/2011,4.5,2,He is a good teacher. I love the way he explains every topic.,M
Saeed  Hamdan,Gwinnett Technical College,Biology department,12/18/2011,5,2,Very good professor. Gave good scenarios to illustrate a topic.,M
Saeed  Hamdan,Gwinnett Technical College,Biology department,05/16/2011,5,3,"Great Teacher! Very knowledgeable due to his background. Makes sure you understand the topics. You have to study for this class regardless of the professor, but doc uses metaphors and analogies so that if you don\'t get it, you need to be thinking about another career.",M
Saeed  Hamdan,Gwinnett Technical College,Biology department,08/06/2010,4.5,2,"I took him for Anatomy 2113/2114. He is an extremely intelligent man and very passionate about what he does. He tells you exactly what to expect from class and tests. He is very blunt, though it seems ""mean"". This class is difficult no matter which teacher you use. So if you do not succeed, it is not the teacher\'s fault. I highly recommend him!",M
Saeed  Hamdan,Gwinnett Technical College,Biology department,02/10/2010,4,3,"Took Dr.Hamdan for both 193/194 and it was great. As long as you do your part to know your material, he will do his in helping you understand. He is very nice and understanding. Easy to get along with.",M
John  Davidson,Greenville Technical College,Computer Science department,11/18/2010,5,3,"Mr. ""D"" is a great teacher in my opinion. He is tough, but straight forward. DON\'T be late or leave early for his class. He loves pop quizes when students are late or leave class early. He is more interested in you learning than you are. Knows his stuff!!",M
John  Davidson,Greenville Technical College,Computer Science department,08/31/2009,4.5,5,"This teacher is very hard, you must be very good at math and able to operate your calculator very effectively. His class is very enjoyable untill you have a quiz or a test because they are recall test instead of A B C or D, If you miss one part of the question or are slightly off, you get the whole question wrong.",M
John  Davidson,Greenville Technical College,Computer Science department,03/19/2009,4.5,4,"This teacher is not as easy as the above guy stated, however he is an excellent teacher no doubt. However he is not very liberal.",M
John  Davidson,Greenville Technical College,Computer Science department,01/29/2009,4,1,This is an excellent teacher. He is more intersted in you passing the class than anything else... Im always late and have come in over two hours late at times with no penality. As long as you show up before class is dismissed you get credit. And the test are so easy!,M
Tim  Turner,Davenport University,Management department,03/30/2016,5,1,"Excellent teacher, there for his students. Easy A but you learn a lot",M
Tim  Turner,Davenport University,Management department,01/29/2009,5,2,Great Teacher very helpful and will go out of his way for you,M
Russel  Willard,Greenville Technical College,Computer Science department,01/29/2009,5,4,This is an absolutely amazing teacher. If you have him there is no way you can fail this class! Excellent teaching method.,M
Taposh  Gayen,City College of New York,Physics department,12/31/2017,1,4,Worst math class Ive had Most of the students were confused He gave a lot of D,M
Taposh  Gayen,City College of New York,Physics department,08/27/2017,5,3,I think he\'s a very good professor. He tries to make sure everyone is on the same page and will go over topics if you don\'t understand. If you just do the stuffs he tells you to do then its an easy A. Just go over the problems he specifically tells you in class or does in blackboard. Those problems are 95% going to be on the test.,M
Taposh  Gayen,City College of New York,Physics department,08/04/2016,5,2,Took a summer course and had a great time even though it was rough and a lot of information because of the professor. Thanks TG!!!,M
Taposh  Gayen,City College of New York,Physics department,07/25/2013,4,3,"I hate to be that 1 review that disagrees with the rest but he\'s REALLY fair. I always knew what to expect on the tests and quizzes & he gave a formula sheet with ALL the formulas & constants. Everyone did poorly on an exam so he gave a retake of it. However, I took it over the summer & had a class size of 15 so that could effect his teaching style",M
Taposh  Gayen,City College of New York,Physics department,06/15/2013,1,5,"You will be in need of a divine miracle if you take this guy. His exams are difficult! Sometimes even the quizzes. For the final he gave us an outline of what to study. Come the day of the exam lo and behold were things that he NEVER INDICATED ON THAT OUTLINE! Oh and forget reporting him to the department, it gets you nowhere smh",M
Taposh  Gayen,City College of New York,Physics department,06/15/2013,1,5,"Did not know what I was getting into when I signed up for his class. Don\'t take this professor unless you know this course will be the ONLY class you\'re taking that semester. I repeat DO NOT take this professor. Yes he curves at the end, but who wants to rely on a curve????!!!His class made my life hell! I have never worked so hard in my life!",M
Taposh  Gayen,City College of New York,Physics department,05/19/2013,3.5,5,"Do him some justice! He DOES curve at the end of the semester. Otherwise, please tell me how students who got 60\'s and 70\'s end up with a B in his class! Yes an A is possible if you do the examples and the HW and actually understand what you\'re doing, you can at least get an A- like I think I will. He cares about us and helps us as much as he can.",M
Taposh  Gayen,City College of New York,Physics department,05/10/2013,1,5,It\'s impossible to capture how terrible this professor is. His testing does not corresponding with the content in the textbook. His lectures are entirely unhelpful. And on top of everything he is a very cheap grader who doesn\'t curve. I have discovered that no amount of preparation will ensure an A on his exams. Avoid at all costs.,M
Taposh  Gayen,City College of New York,Physics department,04/08/2013,1,5,"None of the reviews capture how utterly unprofessional Gayen really is (I\'m nice too, maybe they should hire me!). No explanations during lectures, no clarity, calculus-based handouts posted on Blackboard, ZERO guidance and the midterms do NOT reflect what you will learn on your own from the textbook. This man is not a professor; he\'s a failure.",M
Taposh  Gayen,City College of New York,Physics department,03/19/2013,2.5,3,"Horrible professor. Doesn\'t complete thoughts, very unclear and very hard to understand his english. He seems like a great guy on a personal level but would never take another class of his. Don\'t take his class unless you want to teach yourself physics.",M
Taposh  Gayen,City College of New York,Physics department,09/05/2012,1.5,3,"I wish it weren\'t true, but the stream of consciousness that flows from the professor\'s mouth is maddening. He jumps around a problems without logically explaining topics or fully working through them. His recitation is a joke. The book will be your best friend. Teach yourself the problems he assigns an pay attention to his emphasis. Godspeed.",M
Taposh  Gayen,City College of New York,Physics department,01/13/2012,4.5,2,Tries to be helpful. is definitely available to students. Explains well.,M
Taposh  Gayen,City College of New York,Physics department,01/05/2012,2,4,He can be helpful if you ask questions. Overall is a fair teacher but you must do lots of outside work and studying on top of going to class and doing the homework to do well (unless you are naturally good at physics). Quizzes were pretty easy since they were similar to the homework but the exams were tricky and a lot tougher.,M
Taposh  Gayen,City College of New York,Physics department,07/06/2011,3,3,He teaches straight out the book. So go over all the problems he suggests because most likely those will be quiz and exam questions. Sometimes it is hard to understand him but he is willing to help you during his office hours. I highly recommend that.,M
Taposh  Gayen,City College of New York,Physics department,01/19/2011,2,5,"Not at all my favorite Professor, and he definitely has his favorite students.Some advice if you notice there is a student he likes ask them to ask your questions, otherwise he wont answer them. He gives quizzes that add points to Exams so that is helpful, but he himself is not. Read a lot, pay close attention, do the examples he suggests and STUDY",M
Taposh  Gayen,City College of New York,Physics department,06/02/2010,2,3,"1st test: easy. 2nd test: hard. Final: interesting ... Gayen is not as easy as he used to be. Pay attention to the problems he does in class and says he ""likes."" They will be on the next test. Try to ace the in-class quizzes and get all the lab points to boost your grade after test #2. Do all the example and homework problems. And go to class!",M
Taposh  Gayen,City College of New York,Physics department,04/26/2010,2,4,Well I did not learn anything from going to lecture. He is not the best teacher in the world. You HAVE TO READ the textbook no matter what and do all the examples and problems he assigns you to understand the material. Very nice person though just not the best teacher.,M
Taposh  Gayen,City College of New York,Physics department,12/16/2009,3,2,"As others have said, a very friendly guy--personally I like him--but not a natural teacher. When our class was not getting it, he lowered the bar to the point that I\'m a little scared of what awaits in 204. Still, there are bad teachers who are _not_ friendly, so you could do worse.",M
Taposh  Gayen,City College of New York,Physics department,10/19/2009,3.5,1,"He takes a bit getting used to but he\'s a very nice man who is very straightforward about teaching physics.

If you do the readings, quizzes, discussions every week and the project on time, and with some effort, you should definitely get an A in the class.
